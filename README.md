# **Ra**dial **Ve**locity and **Sp**ectrum **An**alyzer

This is a Python/Qt5 port of the [RaveSpan analysis
tool](http://users.camk.edu.pl/pilecki/ravespan/) developed by Dr.  Bogumi≈Ç
Pilecki at the Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Center of the Polish Academy of
Sciences.

## Port Status

It is far from complete.  I have it partially working under Python 3.10, PyQt5
5.15.7, however it is failing to find files and intermittently crashing.  This
could be operator error, or bugs introduced during porting.
