# **Ra**dial **Ve**locity and **Sp**ectrum **An**alyzer

This is a Python/Qt5 port of the [RaveSpan analysis
tool](http://users.camk.edu.pl/pilecki/ravespan/) developed by Dr.  Bogumi≈Ç
Pilecki at the Nicolaus Copernicus Astronomical Center of the Polish Academy of
Sciences.

## Port Status

It is far from complete.  I have it partially working under Python 3.10, PyQt5
5.15.7, however it is failing to find files and intermittently crashing.  This
could be operator error, or bugs introduced during porting.

## License

I am assuming the original code is AGPLv3 licensed, since the original code
used PyQT4 which is either GPLv3-licensed or commerically licensed, and it's
unlikely a commercial license was ever purchased for RaveSpan, that means the
only legal choices are either GPLv3 or AGPLv3.

Given the request by the author to cite the project in research, this suggests
to me AGPLv3 is the most appropriate.
